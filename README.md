# E-Commerce Website: Software Engineering Final Project

This was the final project for YSC3232 Software Engineering at Yale-NUS College. The goal of this project was to build an e-commerce site end to end with a frontend, backend, and real database. The app was built on Deno with an Eta frontend and a MySQL backend by a team of five. I worked on the frontend views and DB connections, picking up nearly everything from scratch having had no web development experience before. We were also assessed on our development process, for which I served as scrum master, leading documentation efforts, writing user stories, requirements, and managing sprints.

Technologies/Techniques: JS, Deno, Eta, MySQL, Docker, Agile, Model-View-Controller architecture.
